"In my previous role as an instructor, I observed
a troubling trend within Nigeria's tech
institutions: a lack of genuine concern for the
growth and success of students beyond collecting
tuition fees. Outdated curricula and uninspiring
teaching methods were hindering the development of
confident and innovative tech professionals.
Motivated to address this issue, I co-founded
Owlets, aiming to redefine tech education across
all fields. At Owlets, our mission is clear: to
provide aspiring tech enthusiasts with the
necessary tools and resources to thrive in today's
dynamic industry. Over the years, we've supported
over 100 individuals in various tech fields,
offering mentorship and guidance to over 50
professionals. Our dedication to empowering
individuals extends beyond software engineering to
encompass all facets of technology. As we continue
on our journey, we remain steadfast in our
commitment to revolutionize tech education in
Nigeria and beyond. If you share our passion for
driving meaningful change and empowering the next
generation of tech leaders, I encourage you to
reach out. Together, we can build a brighter
future for all within the tech community,
regardless of their chosen field."
